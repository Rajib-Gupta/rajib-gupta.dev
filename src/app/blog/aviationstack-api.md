In today’s fast-paced world, real-time flight information is essential for travelers, businesses, and developers building travel-related applications. The [AviationStack API](https://aviationstack.com/) is a powerful, developer-friendly solution that provides up-to-date flight status, historical data, and global aviation information—all through a simple REST API.

## What is AviationStack?

AviationStack is a cloud-based API that aggregates data from hundreds of sources, including airlines, airports, and aviation authorities. It offers:

- **Live Flight Status:** Real-time updates on departures, arrivals, delays, and cancellations.
- **Global Coverage:** Data from over 13,000 airlines and 10,000 airports worldwide.
- **Historical Data:** Access to past flight records for analytics and reporting.
- **Airport & Airline Lookup:** Retrieve details about airports, airlines, and aircraft types.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API:** Easy to integrate with any modern web or mobile application.
- **Flexible Search:** Query by flight number, route, airport, or airline.
- **JSON Responses:** Clean, developer-friendly data format.
- **Free Tier:** Generous free plan for hobby projects and prototyping.

## Example: Tracking a Flight

Here’s how you can fetch live flight status using the AviationStack API in JavaScript:

```js
const axios = require('axios');

const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const flightNumber = 'AI202';

axios.get(`http://api.aviationstack.com/v1/flights`, {
  params: {
    access_key: API_KEY,
    flight_iata: flightNumber,
  }
})
.then(response => {
  const flight = response.data.data[0];
  console.log(`Flight ${flight.flight.iata} is currently ${flight.flight_status}`);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error fetching flight data:', error);
});
```

## Use Cases

- **Travel Apps:** Show users live flight status, delays, and gate changes.
- **Dashboards:** Monitor airport activity or airline performance.
- **Notifications:** Send alerts for flight status changes.
- **Analytics:** Analyze historical flight data for trends and insights.
